Hi! I am a 25Fall Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC)](https://www.uic.edu/). Previously, I was a research intern at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/), where I worked closely with Prof. [Kaize Ding](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PI3myr8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I received my B.E. in Computer Science from [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/), working closely [with Dawei Cheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4UD20ukAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests focus on:

- **LLM Agents**
- **Time Series Forecasting/Imputation**
- **Graph Anomaly Detection**
